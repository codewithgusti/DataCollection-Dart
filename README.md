# List In Dart

If you want to store multiple values in the same variable, you can use List.
List in dart is similar to Arrays in other programming languages.
E.g. to store the names of multiple students, you can use a List.
The List is represented by Square Braces[].

# Types Of Lists

# 1.Fixed Length List
# 2.Growable List [Mostly Used]

# 1. Fixed Length List
The fixed-length Lists are defined with the specified length.
You cannot change the size at runtime. 
This will create List of 5 integers with the value 0.
